# TwelveData Typescript Wrapper
### A modern library for the TwelveData market API
---------
*As of August 14, 2025 this library is being worked on again :)*

This wrapper provides an option I felt was missing in the official/unofficial TwelveData libraries section for those who are more liable to use Typescript over vanilla Javascript. That being said, this is **very** much a work in progress, and is not ready to be an npm package just yet.
