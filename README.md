# TwelveData Typescript Wrapper
### A modern library for the TwelveData market API
---------

This wrapper provides an option I felt was missing in the official/unofficial TwelveData libraries section for those who are more liable to use Typescript over vanilla Javascript. That being said, this is **very** much a work in progress, and is not ready to be an npm package just yet. 

---
## Roadmap
- Implement all available endpoints.
- NPM Registry.
- Websocket support
